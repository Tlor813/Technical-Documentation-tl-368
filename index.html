          <p>Volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ballback and forth over a high net, trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents’ playing area before it can be returned.</p>
          <p>To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court surface—that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net. A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net and can be returned by:         
          </p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting over the ball</li>
  <li>Spiking the ball over</li>
  <li>Passing the ball over</li>
</ul>

          <p>Volleyball requires a minimum of equipment and space and can be played indoors or outdoors. The game is played on a smooth-surfaced court 9 meters (30 feet) wide by 18 meters (60 feet) long, divided by a center line into two equal areas, one of which is selected by or assigned to each of the two competing teams. </p>
          <p>Players may not step completely beyond the center line while the ball is in play. A line 3 meters (10 feet) from and parallel to the center line of each half of the court indicates the point in front of which a back court player may not drive the ball over the net from a position above the top of the net. (This offensive action, called a spike, or kill, is usually performed most effectively and with greatest power near the net by the forward line of players.)</p>

          <p>Informally, any number can play volleyball. In competition each team consists of six players, three of whom take the forward positions in a row close to and facing the net, the other three playing the back court.  Play is started when the right back (the person on the right of the second row) of the serving team steps outside the end line into the serving area and bats the ball with a hand, fist, or arm over the net into the opponents’ half of the court. The opponents receive the ball and return it across the net in a series of not more than three contacts with the ball. </p>
          <p>This must be done without any player catching or holding the ball while it is in play and without any player touching the net or entering the opponents’ court area. The ball must not touch the floor, and a player may not touch the ball twice in succession. A player continues to serve until that player’s team makes an error, commits a foul, or completes the game. When the service changes, the receiving team becomes the serving team and its players rotate clockwise one position, the right forward shifting to the right back position and then serving from the service area. Either team can score, with points being awarded for successfully hitting the ball onto the opposing side’s half of the court, as well as when the opposing side commits errors or fouls, such as:</p>
          <ul>
  <li>hitting the ball out of bounds</li>
  <li>failing to return the ball</li>
  <li>contacting the ball more than three times before returning it, etc</li>
</ul>

          <p>Competitive teams master six basic skills: serve, pass, set, attack, block and dig. Each of the skills consitsts of a number of specific techniques which have been introduced over the years and are now considered standard practice in high-level volleyball.</p>
          <p>A player stands behind the inline and serves the ball in an attempt to drive it into the opponent's court. The main objective is to make it land inside the court; it is also desirable to set the ball's direction, speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the receiver to handle it properly.[3] A serve is called an "ace" when the ball either lands directly onto the opponent's court or the first opponent to touch the ball is unable to volley it (hit it upwards enough for a teammate to continue).</p>
          <p>Also called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent's serve or any form of attack. Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the court but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely.
</p>
          <p>The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball.[3]The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent's court.[3] The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player who ultimately decides which player will actually attack the ball.</p>

          <p>There are five positions filled on every volleyball team at the elite level: setter, outside hitter (left-side hitter), middle hitter (middle blocker), opposite hitter (right-side hitter) and libero / defensive specialist. Each of the positions plays a specific, key role in winning a volleyball match.</p>
          <p>Setters have the task for orchestrating the offence of the team. They aim for the second touch and their main responsibility is to place the ball in the air where the attackers can place the ball into the opponents' court for a point. They have to be able to operate with the hitters, manage the tempo of their side of the court and choose the right attackers to set. Setters need to have a swift and skillful appraisal and tactical accuracy and must be quick at moving around the court. </p>
          <p>Liberos are defensive players who are responsible for receiving the attack or serve. They are usually the players on the court with the quickest reaction time and best passing skills.Liberos are not permitted to block or perform attacks, meaning they never play at the net, which allows shorter players with strong passing and defensive skills to excel in the position and play an important role in the team's success.</p>
          <p>Middle hitters, or middle blockers, are players that can perform very fast attacks that usually take place near the setter. They are specialized in blocking since they must attempt to stop equally fast plays from their opponents and then quickly set up a double block at the sides of the court.</p>
          <p>Outside hitters, or left-side hitters, attack from near the left antenna. The outside hitter is usually the most consistent hitter on the team and gets the most sets. Inaccurate first passes usually result in a set to the outside hitter rather than middle or opposite. Since most sets to the outside are high, the outside hitter may take a longer approach, always starting from outside the court sideline.</p>
          <p>Opposite hitters, or right-side hitters, carry the defensive workload for a volleyball team in the front row. Their primary responsibilities are to put up a well-formed block against the opponents' Outside hitters and serve as a backup setter. Sets to the opposite usually go to the right side of the antennae.</p>
